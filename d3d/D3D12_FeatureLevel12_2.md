# Feature Level 12_2

## Objectives
Feature level 12_2 exists as a means by which to standardize a set of features across the GPU ecosystem in a way that improves customers' experience with graphical games and applications on the Windows platform.

## Querying and API
The runtime queries the graphics driver for the 12_2 feature level in the same manner it queries for other feature levels.

> Remark
> 
>While feature level 12_2 could be inferred based on the right set of caps being at the right values, the runtime does not do this because inferring feature levels goes against pre-existing designs. Feature level 12_2 is something explicitly reported by the driver.

The enumeration value for 12_2 is expressed as follows:
```
typedef
enum D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL
{
    // ...
	D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_12_2 = 0xc200

} 	D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL;
```

Feature level 12_2 is requested in the same manner as other feature levels, e.g., when creating a device:
```
    ComPtr<ID3D12Device> device;
    D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL featureLevel = D3D_FEATURE_LEVEL_12_2;
    HRESULT hr = D3D12CreateDevice(nullptr, featureLevel, IID_PPV_ARGS(&m_spDevice));
    if (SUCCEEDED(hr))
    {
        // feature level is supported by default adapter
    } 
```

## Capabilities

Feature level 12_2 is expressed in terms of capabilities and feature tiers directly queryable through CheckFeatureSupport.

If a device is feature level 12_2, it has

## DDI
The Direct3D 12 UMD DDI has an enumeration, D3D12DDI_3DPIPELINELEVEL, for describing feature levels. This enumeration has a value for feature level 12.2:

```
typedef enum D3D12DDI_3DPIPELINELEVEL
{
    // ...
    D3D12DDI_3DPIPELINELEVEL_12_2 = 14,
} D3D12DDI_3DPIPELINELEVEL;
```

To find out which feature levels a driver supports, the runtime calls PFND3D12DDI_GETCAPS with 
* D3D12DDICAPS_TYPE_3DPIPELINESUPPORT, or
* D3D12DDICAPS_TYPE_3DPIPELINESUPPORT1

The difference between these two usages of GetCaps is as follows

| Selector            | Data interpretation                                                              | Valid returnable feature levels
|:-                   |-                                                                                 |- 
|3DPIPELINESUPPORT    | D3D12DDI_3DPIPELINELEVEL, simple output value                                    | 12.1 and earlier
|3DPIPELINESUPPORT1   | D3D12DDI_3DPIPELINESUPPORT1_DATA_0081, structure with an input and output field  | any, including 12.2 and later


The definition of D3D12DDI_3DPIPELINESUPPORT1_DATA_0081 is as follows

```
typedef struct D3D12DDI_3DPIPELINESUPPORT1_DATA_0081
{
    D3D12DDI_3DPIPELINELEVEL HighestRuntimeSupportedFeatureLevel; // input
    D3D12DDI_3DPIPELINELEVEL MaximumDriverSupportedFeatureLevel;  // output
} D3D12DDI_3DPIPELINESUPPORT1_DATA_0081;
```

For 3DPIPELINESUPPORT1, the runtime sets the value of HighestRuntimeSupportedFeatureLevel. 
The driver returns a value for MaximumDriverSupportedFeatureLevel which does not exceed HighestRuntimeSupportedFeatureLevel.

>#### Remark
> In practice:
> * Versions of Direct3D built into the operating system at or before Manganese (20H2) use 3DPIPELINESUPPORT.
> * Versions of Direct3D built into Iron operating system or later use 3DPIPELINESUPPORT1, and fall back to 3DPIPELINESUPPORT if it fails.

### Discrepency in API-level and DDI-level reported capabilities
The WriteBufferImmediateSupportFlags capability D3D12_COMMAND_LIST_SUPPORT_FLAG_BUNDLE is switched on at the API level for drivers which report D3D12DDI_COMMAND_QUEUE_FLAG_3D at the DDI level.

## Validation

There is a Direct3D 12 conformance test to validate that a Direct3D 12 device created with feature level 12_2 capability satisfies at least the capabilities outlined in the Capabilities section of this document. This is a conformance test, not an HLK test because it exercises behaviors of the runtime not the driver. Other tests, external to the specific test for feature level 12_2, are in place to ensure that CheckFeatureSupport capabilities properly match with device behavior.
